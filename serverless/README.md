# Serverless Framework
In order to deploy our Node.js app to the AWS cloud we have used the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/), which takes care of everything needed to deploy the app, allowing us to focus on the code itself.

An interesting tool from Serverless Framework that we have also been using, is the [*serverless offline*](https://www.serverless.com/plugins/serverless-offline) plugin, which allow us to test the app locally, before uploading it to the cloud, to ensure its correct logic and operation.

### Implementations:
